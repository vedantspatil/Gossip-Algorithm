# Gossip Algorithm
The objective of this project is to evaluate the convergence behavior of Gossip-style algorithms using a simulator. This simulator is developed in F# and leverages the Akka.NET framework, adhering to the Actor-model. Due to the inherently asynchronous nature of actors in F#, the Gossip algorithm applied here is known as Asynchronous Gossip. This implementation encompasses both Gossip and PushSum algorithms, offering a customizable setting for choosing among various topologies for simulation purposes. A comprehensive description of this project is provided in the document titled "Gossip_Project_Description.pdf.
